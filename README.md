# PAYLOAD-CREATION
# First Mini Project in Cybersecurity

Hello everyone!

I’m thrilled to share my first mini project in the cybersecurity domain. In this project, I utilized the Veil Framework and VirusTotal to deepen my understanding of various cybersecurity tools and techniques.

In the accompanying document, I’ve outlined all the necessary steps to replicate the project.

I hope you find this project useful and informative! Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
